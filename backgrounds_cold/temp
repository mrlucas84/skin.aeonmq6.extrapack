For how much longer must I bleed
Into the soil before I see
The one who holds the blade is me?

For how much longer must I stand
On destiny's uncertain sands
Before I find stability?

One spark among the embers
One voice against surrender
One dream that's worth defending
One love that's neverending

Ignore the underlying cause
Among a thousand last hurrahs
Where every promise is a lie

Externalize the blame for now
The voice of reason disavowed
A slave to all that I decried

One spark among the embers
One voice against surrender
One dream that's worth defending
One love that's neverending

I wear a stranger's face
Not so different from my own
All the steps that I retraced
Left me wounded and alone

For how much longer must I burn
Until I'm able to discern
The root of all this suffering?

For how much longer must I flee
These harsh responsibilities
For the sinking rock to which I cling?

One spark among the embers
One voice against surrender
One dream that's worth defending
One love that's neverending
